Many courses of medication fail because the medication is not remembered to be taken correctly. 
The app for smartphones helps to remember to take medication and thus supports the success of treatment for both adults and children.
 
An easy app is provided to help all users with their medications.
The app has a simple layout and is easy to use. 
The application has the ability to create your own profile, where you put your own information. 
The application can store information about its own medication, as well as monitor its effect using the application's diary function.

The function of the medicine can be recorded in the application, for example with an asterisk or a smile. 
It can monitor and tell your doctor when a side effect may have occurred. 
This is not to forget how the medicine has worked and because there was exactly one side effect. It is a good opportunity for both the users as well as the doctor to help heal soon.
You can save reminders in the application to alert you when you need to take a medicine. 
If you have multiple medications, you can make your own reminder schedules for each medication. 
This is especially helpful when you should remember to take your medicine at a certain time. 
A medicine reminder brings regularity to life.

The application is easy to use and its purpose is suitable for anyone with regular medication or for those undergoing drug medication. 
The same goes for people who take supplements, as vitamins and supplements also have instructions for use that should be followed. 
The application does not need separate sensors or accessories to operate, but a person with medication may have a medication kit at their disposal, which helps facilitate medication monitoring. 
However, the application itself does not require any tools other than the smartphone.
